<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Russia! </h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"> What is Russia? </h3>

<p> Russia is a large country located in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia, and it is spelled "Россия" [Pronounced Roh-see-uh] in the native language of Russian. Russia is the largest country in the world with an area of 17,000,000 Square kilometers, which is significantly larger than Germany, Japan, Italy and Culver's combined. It has a population of about 146,000,000 people, and this massive country expands across 11 time zones. Russia was the first country to launch a man made satellite. Russia was at one point in the Cold War against the United States. Russia has a colder climate as it is located further north. The winters tend to have a lot of snow in them, and temperatures can get dangerously low. The capital of Russia is Moscow, and it has Saint Basil's Cathedral which has very strangely shaped domes on the top of it. </p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"> Why do I want to go there? </h3> 

<p> I would like to go to Russia because I think that the landscape of the area is very cool looking. I think that the sheer size of the country makes it very cool. I also would like to see some of the sights in the capital Moscow. I also think that the language of Russian sounds very interesting. I am trying to learn a little bit of Russian, and it would be satisfying to have practical application. I also would of course love to try the food that they have there. Although it would be a very far trip, I think that in the end I would find it to be a worthwhile trip. </p>
