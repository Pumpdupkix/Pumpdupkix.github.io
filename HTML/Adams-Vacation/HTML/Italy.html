<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Italy! </h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"> What is Italy? </h3>

<p> Italy is a country located in Southern Europe, and it is a peninsula with a few smaller islands around it. Italy in its native language of Italian is "Italia '' [Pronounced it-tal-ee-uh]. Italy has a capital city of Rome, which is a very famous city with a lot of history. Italy is actually the place that the Roman Empire rose out of, which was one of the most advanced empires for its time. Italy has a rich culture and history, along with some very interesting architecture and food. Italy's flag consists of three vertical stripes in the order of Green, White and Red from left to right. Italy is roughly 300,000 square kilometres in area, which makes it the smallest country on this list. Italy is also the third most populated state of the European union, behind Germany and France. </p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"> Why do I want to go there? </h3> 

<p>I want to go to Italy because of the good food that they have there. I have heard about the many, many types of pasta and cheese that they home make there every day. I also want to see Rome and all of the ancient buildings and ruins that are still located there today. I want to go to Venice because it is such a unique place with the rivers and channels instead of having roads. I also would like to get real Parmesan Oregano because you can only get it from special places within Italy that have certain conditions which allow this cheese to be made. </p>
