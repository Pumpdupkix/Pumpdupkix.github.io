<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Culvers's! </h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"> What is Culver's? </h3>

<p> Culver's is a fast food restaurant that is very common in the midwest. Culver's was started in Sauk City, Wisconsin in the year 1984. As of this year it has 808 locations currently operating with 35 more that are in construction. Culver's is most well known for their "ButterBurgers" and Frozen Custard. The restaurant also has a well known blue metal roof at almost every location. Culver's restaurants are open in 25 US states with the majority of them being in the midwest. The restaurant has a mascot named Scoopie who is an ice cream cone with frozen custard. The restaurant was founded by husband and wife George and Ruth Culver. Their son Craig Culver would later help out in running the business after he quit his job at McDonalds. Craig would lead the company until about 2015. </p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"> Why do I want to go there? </h3> 

<p> I want to go to Culver's because the food is just simply the best. Of all fast food places that I have ever been to in my life, chain or not, Culver's is the best. I definitely would say that I have never liked a single restaurant line more than I like Culver's. The burgers are juicy and rich, and they have large portion sizes. The ingredients used on the burgers are all high quality and taste amazing. Don't even get me started on the frozen custard. The shakes and frozen custard are better than any I have had anywhere else. I think that Culver's should be voted as the best fast food restaurant in all of the USA. Culver's also has such a classy yet simple brand design. The restaurants are all very well kept and tidy, and the quality of each location's food is very consistent. The aesthetic of the buildings are all modern, but they don't lose any thier charm. I will support Culver's for all time, and I hope that they make a location that is nearer to me because the nearest is more than 1 hour away. I am only really able to have any when I go to Wisconsin myself, so I hope that one of the 35 new locations in construction is one that is near my house. If possible I would like to remove Chipotle from the center of town and put a Culver's there instead. I think that we should just replace all restaurants in the world with Culver's because it is the only food that you'll ever need. :) </p>
