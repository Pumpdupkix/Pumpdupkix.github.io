<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Germany! </h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"> What is Germany? </h3>

<p> Germany is a country in central Europe, and it is known as Deutschland [Pronounced D-oy-t-ch-land] in its native language German. It has the largest economy in Europe, and the largest city in Germany is the capital, Berlin. Germany has the 4th largest economy by GDP in 2021, and a rich culture and history. The population is roughly 83,000,000 people. Germany was originally controlled by Germanic tribes a very long time ago, and documentations of the country exist throughout history. The flag consists of three stripes that go sideways in the order of Black, Red and Yellow from top to bottom. Germany has an area of 357,000 square kilometers. The country's climate tends to be temperate, with cold winters and hot summers. This climate is pretty similar to what we have here in America and NJ, so it seems like it would be a nice place to be. </p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"> Why do I want to go there? </h3> 

<p> I want to go to Germany so I can get a first-hand experience of the culture like the food and music. I have also heard that the landscape of Germany is very nice. I would like to see as much of the country as I can, including major cities like Berlin and Hamburg. I also want to see the more rural parts of the country. I love brats and other German foods, and I would like to try some of them in their native country. I think that it would be really cool to be in a country where people actually speak another language, because I have not been to any (Canada doesn't count). </p>
