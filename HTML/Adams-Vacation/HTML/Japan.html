<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Japan! </h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"> What is Japan? </h3>

<p> Japan is an island country in East Asia, and it is spelled "日本" [Pronounced Ni-hon] in Japanese. The country is a bit larger than Germany at 377,000 Square kilometers of area. Japan also has a strong economy that is ranked 3rd in GDP in 2021, and it consists of a main island with 6,800 smaller islands around it. Not all of these islands are inhabited, but some are. Some of the major cities like Japan are very densely populated. Japan has one of the highest life expectancies, which may be due to the diet of those who live there. They have a very large fish market, where some fish can go for upwards of $10,000. Japan is also considered to be a part of the ring of fire. The flag of Japan is a big red circle with a white background. I have heard that it is supposed to represent the sun. Japan is the eleventh most populated country in the world, which says a lot about it's population density considering its size. There are about 126,000,000 people living in Japan.   </p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"> Why do I want to go there? </h3> 

<p> I want to go to Japan because I want to see some of the major cities like Tokyo. I also want to see a lot of the more rural areas, along with Mount Fuji which is at an elevation of 12,000 ft. Another reason I really would like to go is because of the food that they have in Japan. I have heard that the sushi and beef that they make in Japan are very good. I also want to see some of the fish markets and maybe even buy a small quantity of fish to eat. I would also like to check out some of the historical places in Japan. </p>
